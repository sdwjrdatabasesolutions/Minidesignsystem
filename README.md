Here’s a clean, professional "README" frame template for your Figma design system, explaining how buyers can use it. You can copy-paste this structure directly into Figma:

🎨 1. How to Edit Colors & Text Styles
Colors:

Go to "Local Variables" (Right Panel) → Edit Color variables.

Change HEX codes to match your brand.

All components will update automatically.

Text Styles:

Open "Text" panel → Click the style dropdown (e.g., "H1 Bold").

Modify font, size, or spacing → Changes apply globally.

⚙️ 2. How to Use Component Variants
Buttons / Inputs / Cards:

Select a component → Check the "Variants" section in the right panel.

Swap between states (e.g., "Primary" → "Disabled") with one click.

Override text/labels by double-clicking.

Auto-Layout Components:

Resize freely—padding and spacing adjust automatically.

🚀 3. How to Extend the System
Add New Components:

Design a new element (e.g., a modal).

Right-click → "Create Component".

Link it to existing styles (use same color/text variables).

Scale for Larger Projects:

Duplicate pages to create "Dark Mode" or "Mobile Breakpoints".

Use "Team Library" to share updates across files.
